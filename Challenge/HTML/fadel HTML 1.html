            How to stay happy and healthy as you age
           </h1>


           <p>As we age, it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to continue enjoying an 
               active, fulfilled life. You can do this by focusing on habits such as regular 
               exercise, proper nutrition, and staying socially active.
            </p>


           <h2>
                Stay socially active with friends and family
           </h2>


           <p>
                Remaining socially connected as you get older is extremely important in order 
                to maintain your physical and mental health. People who are engaged in more social 
                    <br>interaction are typically healthier individuals. Social interaction brings positive 
                feelings and decrease stress. <mark>Seniors who are more socially</mark> active also have lower 
                rates of Alzheimer’s.

                and Prevention states
                    <q> on their website that “physical activity </q>
                can help you maintain a  weight and lower your blood pressure.”
